        <p class="aboutme"><h2>Hello!</h2><br>
        You've stumbled upon my page, so let me tell you a little about myself.<br>
        <br>
        I love everything GIS and map related.  Joining spatial information with non-spatial, tabular data is one of the most powerful tools in data analysis.
        They say "seeing is believing," and anyone familiar with GIS knows this to be absolutely true. A map can tell you so much more than charts and graphs and the only
        way to find these hidden messages is to watch your data come alive through geography.  The only thing better than being able to view and interact with your data in
        this light is the ability to share this insight with others.  In my opinion, there's almost nothing on earth that can't be improved through GIS and spatial analysis.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Professional Experience in a Nutshell</h3><br>
        I am a professional GIS enthusiast with 11 years' experience in map production,
        data management, and data analysis as an environmental consultant. I have worked for many types of clients including agencies under the U.S. Department of
        Defense, federal and state transportation departments, private oil and gas clients, telecommunications, local water/sewer authorities, and private development
        clients. <br><br>
        Projects I have worked on range from wetland delineations, groundwater sampling, environmental soil sampling, environmental site assessments, cultural resource
        investigations, water/sewer asset management, pipeline class location determination studies, Naval firing range design, unexploded ordnance investigations, ground
        penetrating radar studies, to recreational lake capacity/usage studies.<br>
        <br>
        <h3>Let's Get Personal</h3><br>
        Happily married with two small children- nothing makes me happier than to spend time and laugh and play with my family.  I am employed full time at an engineering
        firm as a GIS Analyst and also I am working towards a Master's degree in GIS from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I enjoy golfing, fishing, hockey, and being outdoors.
        One day I will return to those activities, whenever free time once again bestows me with its blessing.
